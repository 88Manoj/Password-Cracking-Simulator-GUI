# Password-Cracking-Simulator-GUI
This project is a Python-based GUI tool designed to simulate password cracking using both dictionary and brute-force attacks. It demonstrates the vulnerabilities of weak passwords and helps users understand the importance of creating strong, secure credentials. The tool allows the use of custom or popular wordlists (e.g., rockyou.txt)
